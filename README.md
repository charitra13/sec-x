## Version History

### v1.30.1 - Blog Administration & Security Enhancement PATCH
- Fixed admin dashboard loading issue where manually inserted MongoDB blogs weren't appearing due to incorrect `status=all` query handling in `getAllBlogs` controller.
- Updated admin edit URLs from ID-based (`/admin/posts/edit/${post._id}`) to slug-based (`/admin/posts/edit/${post.slug}`) to eliminate MongoDB ObjectId exposure.
- Modified edit page API calls from `/blogs/id/${id}` to `/blogs/slug/${slug}` while maintaining PUT requests using internal IDs from fetched data.
- Enhanced edit page error handling with 404-specific messages, loading states, and data validation checks to prevent form submission when blog data isn't loaded.

### v1.30.0 - Registration API Payload Fix PATCH
- Fixed registration API payload mapping to resolve "username is required" error.
- Updated `context/AuthContext.tsx` to map `name` field to `username` in the registration request.
- Changed payload from `{ name, email, password }` to `{ username: name, email, password }`.
- Resolves backend validation error while maintaining frontend form field as "name" for better UX.

### v1.25.0 - Blog Architecture Fixes (Phase 1) MAJOR
- Refactored `/app/blog/page.tsx` to remove in-page blog detail anti-pattern.
- Implemented proper navigation using Next.js router to `/blog/[slug]`.
- Simplified state: removed `selectedBlog`, `isPostLoading`, and back-to-list logic; page now renders listing only.
- Updated `app/components/BlogCard.tsx` to remove root `onClick`, move navigation to the "Read Article" button, and add basic accessibility attributes.
- Result: Correct browser history behavior, cleaner separation of list/detail, reduced state complexity.

### v1.26.0 - Design System Standardization (Phase 2) MINOR
- Added unified blog design components: `BlogGlassCard`, `BlogContainer`, `BlogTypography`, `ContentFormatter` under `components/blog` with central exports from `components/blog/index.ts`.
- Updated `/app/blog/page.tsx` to use the new glassmorphism components for layout and empty states.
- Updated `app/components/BlogCard.tsx` to adopt glass theme and typography, keeping navigation on the action button.
- Result: Consistent styling across blog listing, improved readability and maintainability.

### v1.27.0 - Admin Interface Redesign (Phase 3) MINOR
- Added glassmorphism admin UI components in `components/admin/AdminComponents.tsx` (`AdminGlassCard`, `AdminTable`, `AdminTableHeader`, `AdminTableBody`).
- Redesigned `/admin/dashboard` to use Blog design system and glass table styling. Added loading/error glass cards and a View action.
- Implemented dark theme for ReactQuill (`styles/dark-quill.css`) and imported in `app/globals.css`.
- Updated `admin/posts/new` and `admin/posts/edit/[id]` forms to use `AdminGlassCard`, `BlogContainer`, and the `dark-quill` class with enhanced toolbar.
- Result: Unified admin styling consistent with blog theme and improved editor UX.

### v1.28.0 - Enhanced UX (Phase 4) MINOR
- Redesigned comments: `CommentForm` now uses textarea with character count, glass styling, and improved unauthenticated state; `CommentList` displays comments in glass cards with avatars and better metadata.
- Enhanced search: `SearchBar` updated to glassmorphism styling with icon, disabled state, and future suggestions scaffold.
- Content formatting: `formatBlogContent` now uses `BlogTypography`, improved bullets, quotes, and code block styling.
- `BlogPostTemplate` content, share, related, and comments sections updated to use glass components and typography.

### v1.29.0 - Performance & Accessibility (Phase 5) MINOR
- Implemented blog pagination: added `components/blog/BlogPagination.tsx` and integrated into `/app/blog/page.tsx` with URL param support.
- Enhanced accessibility in `BlogCard` (descriptive alt text, ARIA, lazy-loaded images, focus states).
- Added `lib/performance.ts` with helpers (`getOptimizedImageUrl`, `lazyWithPreload`, `useDebounce`).
- Improved admin editor performance: lazy loading `ReactQuill` with styled loading fallbacks.

### v1.24.4 - Remove MeshBackground and Legacy Files (Current) PATCH
- Deleted `app/components/MeshBackground.tsx` after migrating all pages to the standard black background.
- Removed obsolete project documents/files: `REMAINING_AUTH_TASKS.md`, `auth-state.md`, `cold-start.md`, `cors frontend.md`, `skeleton-implmentation.json`.
- No runtime impact expected; visual consistency improved and repository tidied.

### v1.24.3 - Remove MeshBackground Usage (Current) PATCH
- Removed all imports/usages of `MeshBackground` to standardize on the global black background.
- Updated user dashboard to rely on default layout background; no visual mesh overlays.

- Changed files: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

### v1.24.2 - Admin Layout Cleanup PATCH
- Removed `MeshBackground` and duplicate `Footer` from admin layout to prevent animated background and double footer on admin pages (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`).
- Admin pages now rely on the global footer from `app/layout.tsx` and present a clean, focused dashboard experience.
- Changed files: `app/admin/layout.tsx`.

### v1.24.1 - Server Warming Endpoint Path Fix PATCH
- Updated server and blog warming health checks to use `/health` instead of `/api/health` to avoid Vercel proxy double `/api` causing 404s when targeting Render backend.
- Updated blog warming blogs request to use `/blogs` instead of `/api/blogs` for consistency with proxy behavior.
- Changed files: `lib/serverWarming.ts`, `lib/blogWarming.ts`.

### v1.24.0 - Frontend Cold Start Warming Services (Current) MAJOR

- Added `WarmingProvider` and integrated it into `app/layout.tsx`.
- Optional dev-only `WarmingStatus` component for live monitoring.
- Configuration via environment:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WARMING=true`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com`

Changed files:
- `lib/serverWarming.ts`
- `lib/blogWarming.ts`
- `lib/warmingManager.ts`
- `hooks/useServerWarming.ts`
- `app/providers/WarmingProvider.tsx`
- `app/layout.tsx`
