## Version History

### v1.25.0 - Blog Architecture Fixes (Phase 1) MAJOR
- Refactored `/app/blog/page.tsx` to remove in-page blog detail anti-pattern.
- Implemented proper navigation using Next.js router to `/blog/[slug]`.
- Simplified state: removed `selectedBlog`, `isPostLoading`, and back-to-list logic; page now renders listing only.
- Updated `app/components/BlogCard.tsx` to remove root `onClick`, move navigation to the "Read Article" button, and add basic accessibility attributes.
- Result: Correct browser history behavior, cleaner separation of list/detail, reduced state complexity.

### v1.24.4 - Remove MeshBackground and Legacy Files (Current) PATCH
- Deleted `app/components/MeshBackground.tsx` after migrating all pages to the standard black background.
- Removed obsolete project documents/files: `REMAINING_AUTH_TASKS.md`, `auth-state.md`, `cold-start.md`, `cors frontend.md`, `skeleton-implmentation.json`.
- No runtime impact expected; visual consistency improved and repository tidied.

### v1.24.3 - Remove MeshBackground Usage (Current) PATCH
- Removed all imports/usages of `MeshBackground` to standardize on the global black background.
- Updated user dashboard to rely on default layout background; no visual mesh overlays.
- Preparing to delete `app/components/MeshBackground.tsx` in a later cleanup once confirmed unused.
- Changed files: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

### v1.24.2 - Admin Layout Cleanup PATCH
- Removed `MeshBackground` and duplicate `Footer` from admin layout to prevent animated background and double footer on admin pages (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`).
- Admin pages now rely on the global footer from `app/layout.tsx` and present a clean, focused dashboard experience.
- Changed files: `app/admin/layout.tsx`.

### v1.24.1 - Server Warming Endpoint Path Fix PATCH
- Updated server and blog warming health checks to use `/health` instead of `/api/health` to avoid Vercel proxy double `/api` causing 404s when targeting Render backend.
- Updated blog warming blogs request to use `/blogs` instead of `/api/blogs` for consistency with proxy behavior.
- Changed files: `lib/serverWarming.ts`, `lib/blogWarming.ts`.

### v1.24.0 - Frontend Cold Start Warming Services (Current) MAJOR
- Implemented frontend-based server warming to prevent Render cold starts.
- Added blog prefetching with localStorage cache and periodic warming.
- Introduced warming manager to orchestrate services with visibility handling.
- Created React hook `useServerWarming` for status and manual trigger.
- Added `WarmingProvider` and integrated it into `app/layout.tsx`.
- Optional dev-only `WarmingStatus` component for live monitoring.
- Configuration via environment:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WARMING=true`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com`

Changed files:
- `lib/serverWarming.ts`
- `lib/blogWarming.ts`
- `lib/warmingManager.ts`
- `hooks/useServerWarming.ts`
- `app/providers/WarmingProvider.tsx`
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/components/WarmingStatus.tsx` (optional dev tool)

### v1.23.0 - User Authentication Navigation Integration  MAJOR
- **UserMenu Component**: Created new `UserMenu.tsx` component with dropdown functionality for authenticated users.

- **Dropdown Animations**: Added smooth dropdown fade in/out animations to `globals.css`.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensured UserMenu works seamlessly in both desktop and mobile navigation.

- **User Experience**: Displays user's first name with avatar placeholder and logout functionality.

### v1.22.0 - Blog, BlogCard, and Skeleton Loader Enhancements
- **Blog Page & BlogCard Improvements**: Updated `/blog/page.tsx` and `BlogCard` for enhanced UI, category color-coding, and author info.
- **Skeleton Loader System**: Added comprehensive skeleton loading system for blog, admin dashboard, analytics, and user management pages.
  - Created reusable skeleton components: `Skeleton`, `SkeletonText`, `SkeletonCard`, `SkeletonTable`, `SkeletonAvatar`.
  - Added page-level loading states for `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/analytics`, `/admin/users`, `/blog`, and `/blog/[slug]`.
  - Implemented composite skeletons: `DashboardSkeleton`, `BlogGridSkeleton`, `BlogPostSkeleton`, `UserTableSkeleton`.
- **Tailwind & Global Styles**: Updated `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` for custom animations and glassmorphism effects.
- **Accessibility & Performance**: Improved screen reader support, focus management, and reduced motion support in skeletons.
